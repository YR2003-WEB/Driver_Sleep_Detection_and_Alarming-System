# Driver_Sleep_Detection_and_Alarming-System
This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness and yawning detection system using Raspberry Pi 5, aimed at improving road safety by preventing fatigue-related accidents.

🔍 Project Overview

The system continuously monitors the driver’s face through a camera and analyzes eye aspect ratio (EAR) and mouth movements to detect signs of drowsiness and yawning. When fatigue is detected beyond a threshold, an audio alarm is triggered to alert the driver.

⚙️ Key Features

Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade

Eye and mouth landmark detection using dlib (68-point model)

Drowsiness detection based on eye closure duration

Yawning detection based on mouth opening ratio

Audible alert for driver warning

Optimized for Raspberry Pi 5 performance

🛠️ Technologies Used

Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5, USB Camera, Buzzer/Speaker

Software: Python, OpenCV, dlib

Models: Haar Cascade Classifier, 68 Facial Landmark Predictor
